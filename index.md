# Object Detection Model For Cars
I worked on an object detection model using machine learning to accurately predict the type of car, specifically the model of it, when its image is captured. In addition, any time a car comes too close to you on the road, I created a design so that an alert will pop up on your phone as a notificationto be aware of your surroundings, especially at that particular time.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone involved setting up my raspberry pi and being able to detect the car and its model with accuracy. I used the supervised training model Nanonets to formulate my car model, and I was able to create a python script that would upload images of the different car types I wanted to predict - Acura, Audi, Dodge, Ford, and Hyundai - and their corresponding annotations that I was able to get from a car dataset. This made it much easier to train the model as I did not have to draw bounding boxes manually. The code already did it for me. When my model was first created, it was at 88% accuracy, but after testing more and more car images, the accuracy kept increasing. Now, it is at 99.5%. I also created another python script, "prediction.py", that would be able to test images using the model solely through code and not the UI on Nanonets itself.
