# Project Name/Title Goes Here
I worked on an object detection model using machine learning to accurately predict the type of car, specifically the model of it, when its image is captured. In addition, any time a car comes too close to you on the road, I created a design so that an alert will pop up on your phone as a notificationto be aware of your surroundings, especially at that particular time.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone involved setting up my raspberry pi, getting the camera to work, and being able to at least detect the car and its model with moderate accuracy.
